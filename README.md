This XMLTV "grabber" is used to provide a way of loading a valid XMTV file into any application that supports the various XMLTV grabbers.

It will respond to a small number of XMLTV options, just enough to pass as a valid XMLTV grabber, and it will just pass a valid XMLTV file to the requesting program.
